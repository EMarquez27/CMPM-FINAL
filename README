EIGEN GRAU
Final project for CMPM 120 
Eigen: Grau is a dating simulator that follows our main character through the world of Eigen. She wakes up in a scrapyard and finds herself smitten with a fierce lady named Bianca. 

[main game] The documentation links to a deployed version of the main game compatible with mobile browsers. (This might be on GitHub pages, Itch.io, or other web hosting site.)

[prototypes] The documentation links to the deployed version of three playable prototypes (core gameplay, scene flow, and cinematics). (They don't need to be deployed on the same platform as the main game, but the audience needs to be able to play them by simply clicking a direct link to them.)

Core gameplay prototype: https://jmreavis.github.io/CMPM-GameplayPrototype/
Cinematics prototype: https://emarquez27.github.io/cinematics-prototype1/
Scene flow prototype: Https://BurntThanatoast.github.io


[theme] The documentation describes how the theme of "nearby in space, but distant in time" was addressed in the main game's design. (One sentence would be sufficient, but try to keep the description to a single paragraph even if you want to give more detail.)
The theme is addressed through the setting of the story. Our main character has woken up in a scrapyard after years of being asleep. Our dating sim revolves around her finding her way through a land further into the future. 

[selectable requirements] The documentation describes which of the three selectable requirements your team is attempting to satisfy (see below).

[contributor credits] The documentation identifies all of the direct contributors to the code and their assigned roles (e.g. "testing lead")

PRODUCTION LEAD - ELYZZA JOYCE MARQUEZ
TESTING LEAD - JOSHUA VAILLANCOURT


[asset credits] If the team has built there game using assets created by anyone else (even if those assets were modified before inclusion in the game), the upstream source of those assets should be credited in the documentation as well.
